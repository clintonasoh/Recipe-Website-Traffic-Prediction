# Predicting Popular Recipes for Website Traffic Optimization

This project aims to leverage data science and predictive analytics to enhance Tasty Bytes' recipe discovery platform. Tasty Bytes, a popular recipe search engine, wants to boost website traffic and increase subscriptions by displaying popular recipes on its homepage. The current approach relies on the Product Manager's selection of their favorite recipe, which has led to inconsistent results.

To address this challenge, our Data Science team built a predictive model to identify high-traffic recipes that are likely to drive more website visits and user engagement. The goal is to replace the manual selection process with data-driven predictions that optimize the content displayed on the homepage.

## Key Objectives:

1. Predict high-traffic recipes with high accuracy to maximize website traffic.
3. Develop a model to identify popular recipes with at least 80% success rate.
4. Provide actionable insights to enhance user engagement and overall platform performance.

## Methodology:

- We began with data exploration, validation, and cleaning to ensure high-quality data.
- The project involved binary classification, aiming to classify recipes as high-traffic (positive class) or not.
- We trained and evaluated the model using Logistic Regression, considering its interpretability and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

## Results:

- The Logistic Regression model achieved a remarkable Recall of 100%, successfully predicting all high-traffic recipes from the actual high-traffic instances.
- We identified key features that significantly influence recipe popularity and website traffic.

## Recommendations:

1. Implement the Logistic Regression model for recipe selection on the homepage to drive website traffic.
2. Continuously monitor and evaluate model performance, focusing on Recall as the primary metric.
3. Encourage user engagement through interactive features like recipe ratings and comments to improve the model's accuracy.
4. Conduct A/B testing to validate the model's impact and optimize homepage content.

By integrating data-driven decision-making, Tasty Bytes can enhance the user experience, drive website traffic, and ensure visitors discover the most popular and enticing recipes daily.
